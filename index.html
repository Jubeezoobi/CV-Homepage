          <h1>Eli Ponczek</h1>
          <h2>Technical Lead | Multi-Disciplinary</h2>
          <p>
            Working in a start-up agile environment and have a strong background
            in corporate environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            For over twelve years, I have been translating customer needs into
            easy to relate stories and then to detailed technical requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I have developed strong analytical skills, a proven
            ability to understand and communicate technical concepts as well as
            business concepts and a track record of collaborating with
            multi-disciplinary development teams to build strong products.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like working with great autonomy and have very good communication
            and presentation skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm always looking to challenge myself and try to learn new things
            every day and broaden my knowledge in variety of topics from social
            economics to biodiversity and climate change. I became vegan a
            couple of years ago and started recycling more and more to have a
            positive impact on my friends and on the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I train in martial-arts, practice yoga, play the
            piano and read.
